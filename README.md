# IDNYT - Modernizing NYIT With Just a Tap!


Here at NYIT, we are coming to campus gradually. However, due to COVID protocols, things are a bit more cumbersome and counterproductive to a campus environment that prioritizes minimal spread. Currently, students are required to show the results of their COVID-19 screening to the main building to receive a sticker as verification to access and attend class. This contact between every student and the security staff is likely to be a spreading risk. Additionally, at New York Institute of Technology, it feels a bit behind the times for us to rely on physical attendance sheets and IDs. Between late students needing to disrupt the professor’s attention, and therefore the pace of the lecture by asking for the attendance sheet, the additional contact point between everyone in the room nullifying social distancing recommendations, and professors needing to remember to keep record of the attendance sheets rather than have the students scan themselves in, it causes multiple halts in the pace of the lecture. All of these problems could be resolved in one single app; which we as a group called IDNYT. This app intends to contain both a student’s school ID and proof of COVID-19 vaccination or negative PCR test results to their phones and complete the daily COVID screening form to quickly gather an NFC authorization for classroom attendance. This app serves as both entry to the building as well as logging the student down for attendance, both eliminating contact points with security and allowing professors to focus on their lectures.
